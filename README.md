### What I learned

After 2 projects of failing with making te web page responsive, I was able to make this responsive. I have made a tablet and mobile version too along with the desktop version.

I depended mostly on Youtube for the exact measurements of padding, margins and font size. I also want to correct the responsiveness on my webpages. 

Saw how much a gap in container could effect the total look. Was able to understand if something looks a bit off at any particular place of the final version
